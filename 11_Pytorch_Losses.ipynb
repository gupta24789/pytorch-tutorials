    "Your neural networks can do a lot of different tasks. Whether it’s classifying data, like grouping pictures of animals into cats and dogs, regression tasks, like predicting monthly revenues, or anything else.  Every task has a different output and needs a different type of loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way you configure your loss functions can make or break the performance of your algorithm. By correctly configuring the loss function, you can make sure your model will work how you want it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, there are loss functions we can use to make the most of machine learning tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we’ll talk about popular loss functions in PyTorch, and about building custom loss functions. Once you’re done reading, you should know which one to choose for your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the loss functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into PyTorch specifics, let’s refresh our memory of what loss functions are. \n",
    "\n",
    "Loss functions are used to gauge the error between the prediction output and the provided target value. A loss function tells us how far the algorithm model is from realizing the expected outcome. The word ‘loss’ means the penalty that the model gets for failing to yield the desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a loss function (let’s call it J) can take the following two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicted output (y_pred)\n",
    "- Target value (y)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function will determine your model’s performance by comparing its predicted output with the expected output. If the deviation between y_pred and y is very large, the loss value will be very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the deviation is small or the values are nearly identical, it’ll output a very low loss value. Therefore, you need to use a loss function that can penalize a model properly when it is training on the provided dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which loss functions are available in PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, loss functions in PyTorch are divided into two main categories: regression losses and classification losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression loss** functions are used when the model is predicting a continuous value, like the age of a person. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification loss** functions are used when the model is predicting a discrete value, such as whether an email is spam or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ranking loss** functions are used when the model is predicting the relative distances between inputs, such as ranking products according to their relevance on an e-commerce search page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we’ll explore the different types of loss functions in PyTorch, and how to use them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error Loss\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error Loss\n",
    "- Negative Log-Likelihood Loss\n",
    "- Cross-Entropy Loss\n",
    "- Hinge Embedding Loss\n",

    "KL Divergence behaves just like Cross-Entropy Loss, with a key difference in how they handle predicted and actual probability. Cross-Entropy punishes the model according to the confidence of predictions, and KL Divergence doesn’t. KL Divergence only assesses how the probability distribution prediction is different from the distribution of ground truth.\n",
